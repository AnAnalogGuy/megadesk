# megadesk
Custom Arduino-based Bekant controller. Design goals were to have it fit in the original housing and use as many stock parts as possible.

# Parts
If you want to create your own cable, the connector is a 4.2mm pitch (0.165"), AMP VAL-U-LOK by TE Coonectivity. This is available from DigiKey with part number A112430-ND or A112983-ND. I'm not sure on the difference between them to be honest. Don't forget the crimp pins - A30642-ND. Otherwise, the existing cable can be unsoldered from the board. Red is positive (24VDC), white is negative, blue is LIN.

# Atmega Fuses
Don't forget to set fuses on your board. 

Prototyping - ATMega 328p - 8Mhz internal `avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328p -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m`

PCB - ATTiny 841 - 8Mhz internal  `avrdude -c usbtiny -p t841 -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m`

# Current
16mA on the Atmega 328P, 3mA on the MCP2003B.
