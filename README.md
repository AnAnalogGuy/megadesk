# megadesk

Do you wish your IKEA Bekant had memory buttons? I sure did. So I made megadesk. Design goals were to have it fit in the original housing and use as many stock parts as possible, be completely independant of the existing controller, as well as store any number of memory positions.

# For sale on Tindie - Plug and Play!
I've setup a store on Tindie for those who wish to order a ready to go, plug and play version. It comes with a fully assembled PCB as well as the cable you will need to connect it. No soldering or assembly required! <a  href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gcormier/megadesk/">https://www.tindie.com/products/gcormier/megadesk/</a>

# Disassembly of the existing control unit
I now have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCPlM2KYwDQ">video with a few tips</a> on disassembling the IKEA Bekant controller and installing megadesk. Due to popular request, I now have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiOev3miDo8">second video with live surgery</a> of a brand new, unopened control unit.

## Video
Unfortunately the beeps aren't captured well in the video unless you turn up the volume.

# Variants
A second variant to the protocol has been found. It is the larger sized BEKANT, so it is possible it has different motors. These motors report their "idle" status value as 0 instead of 96, which can cause the buttons to not respond. 

Pressing the UP button 16 times will play an ascending tone 3x and toggle the value (saved in EEPROM for persistence) that it will use.

- Small is 120cm x 80cm (47 1/4" x 31 1/2")
    - Default firmware, should work out of the box
    - When toggling modes, this is confirmed with a descending tone three times
- Large is 160cm x 80cm (63" x 31 1/2") 
    - Requires the 16x VARIANT toggle
    - When toggling modes, this is confirmed with an ascending tone three times

# Troubleshooting
1. Have you tried turning it off again? :)
    - Seriously - from testing many of these units, about 1 out of 20 times the handshake seems to fail as it does contain some random elements. A simple power cycle will provide a new handshake and the unit will power up.
    - Try unplugging the desk from the wall and plugging it back in (With megadesk connected)
    - Alternatively, try powering on the desk with NO controller attached, and then plugging in the megadesk after the desk is powered on.
2. Is the safety key inserted? It is still required for the motors to engage. You will not hear any beeps when using buttons if it is removed.
3. Try toggling to the variant mode described above by pushing UP 16 times. You'll hear a unique series of tones depending which mode it's in.
    - Descending tone 3x, megadesk is now in VARIANT mode.
    - Ascending tone 3x, megadesk is now in the original mode.
4. Test the up/down button connectivity
    - Holding UP while powering on will enter a button test mode, where the up/down buttons can be held to test that they are working - a power cycle is required to exit this mode.
5. Clear all settings/memory
    - Holding DOWN while powering on will wipe the EEPROM memory - a power cycle is required to exit this mode. Note this will clear the VARIANT setting.
    - Make sure to re-enable the VARIANT setting if it was required initially
6. Recalibrate/reset the motors (New discovery : July 2020)
    - This step must be done with the **ORIGINAL** BEKANT controller.
    - Hold the UP and DOWN buttons for 8 seconds, after that let go of up while maintaining the pressure on the down button.
    - The desk will lower until it stops on its own.
    - Let go of all buttons, and test regular desk functionality with the original controller.
    - Once functionality is confirmed, replace with megadesk.
