# Variants
(Updated Feb 20, 2021)
There are now 3 different status codes, which means 3 possible configurations. The unit ships by default with mode 1 activated. Changing to an incorrect mode will not harm the desk. The unit will beep and be responsive, but the motors will not engage.

(older software)
Pressing the UP button 16 times will play a 2-note "beep-boop" tone. 
- Single - variant mode 1
- Double - variant mode 2
- Triple - variant mode 3

Any unit shipped after Feb 20, 2021 from the Tindie store will have the 3rd mode. Units from shipped prior will need to be flashed with the new firmware.
